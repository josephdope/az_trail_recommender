    "The data was scraped from AllTrails.com using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. One of the challenges of gathering the necessary data was getting the webpages to render all of the necessary information. When originally gathering all of the trails in Arizona, the entire list of trails would not generate unless a scrolling action would occur. As such, Selenium was used to create an artificial scrolling action to populate the webpage with all of the trails. A method was created within the class DataGrabber in order to perform the scroll action and grab the trail names and their links, which were then exported to a postgres sql database. Execute the cell below to see it in action. A new browser window will open. \n",

The dist column was changed so the any data displayed in kilometers was converted to miles and any text was removed. This was similar to the elev column as meters were converted to feet and text was removed. type and difficulty were dummied. The tags were also represented in a way so that if they were present in the trail description, they received a 1 and a 0 if not. The overview and full_desc columns were combined and tf-idf was performed so that words that were more unique to the trail received a higher weighting. Finally, the data was normalized to set all features on the same scale."
