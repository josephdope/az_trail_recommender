    "The data was scraped from AllTrails.com using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. A list of 1418 trails in Arizona was gathered. The reviews of each trail were then collected and exported to a SQL database. This was a bit challenging, as the only way to load more reviews was to click a button that would populate more reviews. This action would load 30 more reviews each time, so it had to be done repeatedly. As such, Selenium was used to located the button on click it (total reviews/30) times. For this demonstration, the class created to extract the data from the webpages will not be used. The data will be imported from the SQL database"
