The trail offers a number of activity options and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.	Devils Bridge is the largest natural sandstone arch located in the Sedona area of the Coconino National Forest. This is a very popular hike that offers breathtaking views of Red Rock country.\n\nIt is a steep but short hike. The official trailhead starts off the unpaved portion of Dry Creek Road and requires a high clearance vehicle to access. If you only have a low clearance vehicle, you can park at the Dry Creek Road trailhead at the paved section, approximately 1 mile from trailhead, or at the Mescal Trailhead located on Long Canyon Road. Depending on where you park you have a few routes to choose from to access Devils Bridge Trail, including the unpaved portion of Dry Creek Road, Chuckwagon Trail, or Mescal to Chuckwagon Trail.\n\nFrom the parking area off of the unpaved portion of Dry Creek Road, follow the trailmarker for Devil's Bridge Trail. The early portion of the trail was originally a jeep trail so it is smooth and traverses through washes filled with juniper and prickly pear cactus. The path gently inclines uphill and gets steeper as you continue on.\n\nAbout 3/4 of a mile from the parking area the trail will come to a fork and you will go left. Here you'll end up at the base of the bridge. You will then continue up a natural rock staircase from which there are beautiful views. You will reach another level of stairs which will take you up to the bridge.\n\nThis popular trail is certainly a tourist attraction so make sure to arrive early to avoid large crowds. This is a fun hike for the whole family.

Although they tend to avoid hot day hiking in summer months.\n\nAn access trail for rock climbers leads to the summit, but hikers are not allowed on this part of the mountain. Note to climbers: park staff does not create or maintain fixed anchors on any climbing route, but new routes requiring fixed anchors are not allowed. Fixed anchor locations are limited to those already established.

This fun 1.3 mile route becomes increasingly rocky and precipitous, and though the conditions here are not extreme, we'd certainly urge caution and wouldn't recommend this route for young children or folk with a strong aversion to heights.\n\nElevation gain: \n- Approx. 1,300ft (from 1,450 - 2,680ft)\n\n

When you say "North Mountain," most Arizonans know where it is or can find it.  When you say "Shaw Butte," it seems like you get a lot more questioning glances and "huh?".  Shaw Butte is the other side of the preserve.

The trail is primarily used for hiking, camping, and backpacking and is accessible year-round.	Hikers must get a permit from the Havasupai Indian Reservation for this hike. You must get them well in advance.\n\nThis is a very popular overnight backpacking trip. There are several variations hikers can do, including various falls, the confluence with the Colorado River, and the town of Supai.\n\nThe Havasupai Indian Reservation is not part of the Grand Canyon National Park, but you cannot tell that from the scenery. From your very first step at the trailhead parking lot until your return at the end of your trip, you will be swiveling your head side to side to take it all in.\n\nThe water is a turquoise blue/green and the perfect way to refresh the tired legs and back after the 12 mile trek down to the campground.  \n\nThe parking lot at the trailhead is stunning. It is perched more than 1000 feet above the valley floor and provides one of the best vistas of the trip.\n\nThe trail starts with a steep descent down the face of the box canyon to the valley floor on a  series of switchbacks. Be on the lookout for the approaching mules. They have the right-of-way, and won't stop to wait for you to move to the side.\n\nOnce you reach the valley floor, the trail bends to the north and follows the wash for 8 miles into the town of Supai. Along the way, the canyon walls draw closer and the surroundings become more grand. You get a sense for the true size of the canyon walls when then tower hundreds of feet straight up as you make your way down the canyon.\n\nThere is more shade in this narrow section of trail. The sun doesn't have the angle to penetrate the canyon and it helps to keep temperatures down. In this slot section ( which starts at about mile 7), you really need to watch for the mule packs. As they approach, move to the canyon wall side and not the cliff side.\n\nAt the end of the slot section, it opens and the Havasu Creek comes in from the right side.  As you cross the open expanse, following the trail as it curves to the left, you will hear the water for the first time. It comes into view as you enter the heavier vegetation. The town of Supai is close. You will follow the irrigation channel into Supai.\n\nThe two miles following the town of Supai are packed with waterfalls, blue-green water, and tons of photo opportunities. It's just 2 miles to Havasu Falls from Supai. The campground and Mooney Falls are just beyond that.\n\nVisitors must camp overnight at either the campground near Havasu Falls or the Havasupai Lodge in Supai. Some adventurous hikers continue on to reach the confluence with the Colorado River.

Day hike to the mule hitching post at Cedar Ridge is 3 miles (round trip). Best views for a relatively short hike. Steep trail, no water, little shade. Water available seasonally at the trailhead. Upper portion of the trail may be extremely icy in winter or early spring and in summer months watch out for thunderstorms.  This is the only trail at Grand Canyon National Park that holds true to a ridgeline descent. This trail is also the quickest way to the bottom.   The trail begins with a series of\ntight switchbacks. After these initial switchbacks, the trail traverses below Yaki Point to Ooh Ah Point (the first panoramic view of the canyon).  From Ooh Ah Point on, the trail follows the top of a ridgeline and is consequently without shade. Several broad and steeply plunging switchbacks later, hikers reach Cedar Ridge. \n\nThe South Kaibab Trail was constructed to bypass Ralph Cameron's Bright Angel Trail.  Cameron, who owned the Bright Angel Trail and charged a toll to those using it, fought dozens of legal battles over several decades to maintain his personal business rights. These legal battles inspired the Santa Fe Railroad to build its own alternative trail, the Hermit Trail, beginning in 1911 before the National Park Service went on to build the South Kaibab Trail beginning in 1924. In this way, Cameron inadvertently contributed  to the greater network of trails currently available for use by canyon visitors.

Absolutely amazing.\n \nAlthough hot and at least moderately strenuous, well worth the time.

This description starts from the Holbert TH and ends at the Mormon TH. See Directions for both at the bottom of the page. The Holbert TH takes you immediately into a passageway of large rock and if you look up you will start to see the ancient Rock Art appearing. You will travel out of the passageway into a fairly open area with more Petroglyphs on large and small boulders along the trail route. You will also see Petroglyphs on the rocks further above the trail on the hillside. After you encounter a large picnic area, the trail going east will gradually start to climb and soon you will parallel a paved road going to a large water tank against a hill. The Trail starts turning here to the south and the grade becomes a little steeper. You enter a large canyon and the trail becomes steeper yet, but is far from unmanageable and is well defined. The canyon serves as a large drainage and judging from the rock and steepness, is probably quite a site after a very large rainstorm. Don't forget to turn around every once in awhile and enjoy the views of the canyon and the city behind you. As you near the top of this canyon you will likely encounter more people as you pass Promontory Point, a scenic vista area with a large rock Ramada, with vehicle parking and restrooms.

Located at the Northwest side of Tucson on the edge of front range of the Santa Catalina Mountains lies the Iris O. Dewhirst trail. Also commonly known as the Pima Canyon Trail #62. This well traveled and well known trail is popular among trail runners,  hikers, and day trippers of the Tucson area.\n\nThough the stream in Pima Canyon is dry for most of the year, it supports an excellent example of a desert riparian habitat located conveniently close to the Tucson metropolitan area. Unfortunately, that accessibility has resulted in significant overuse of this beautiful and fragile area, especially during the winter, its season of highest use. From the trailhead, located among suburban ranchos, the trail ascends a V-shaped notch carved along the south face of Pusch Ridge. Views down the canyon get better as you climb, encompassing the city of Tucson as well as distant mountains and valleys. The riparian area on the floor of the canyon provides excellent birdwatching for a wide variety of resident and migratory species that make use of this most productive of all desert habitat types. Other desert creatures you may encounter in this area include javelina and jackrabbits, but the real viewing prize of Pima Canyon and the entire Pusch Ridge area are the desert bighorn sheep that maintain a surefooted existence here among rocky crags and rugged canyons. Beyond Pima Spring, the trail becomes steeper and harder to follow as it continues to climb to the upper slopes of Mt. Kimball. Incentives for persevering here are good views of Window Rock and Cathedral Rock. Trail #62 ends at its junction with the Finger Rock Trail #42.

The trail offers a number of activity options and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.	Deem Hills is one of the newer parks in Phoenix to open (2010) and as such a lot of people still don't know it's there.  This means that it has much more of a secluded feel then some of the more well established trails around.  It IS popular with mountain bikers though so be on the lookout for them as they like the more sparse feel as well.  The main park entrance is in the Stetson Hills community with the nearest cross streets of 51st Ave and Happy Valley Rd.\n\nDeem Hills is really 2 hills in one with a just under 6 mile circumference trail around both.\n\nThe trail itself is actually pretty nice and well cut through the desert but be aware that it can still be pretty loose in places, probably because it is so new.  For an average hiker it's a very nice hike but for a beginner there are inclines that might seem a bit tough in places, especially if you head up to the summit (the Ridgeline Trail).  The summit has a couple nice overlooks where you can take some pictures and is challenging enough to be worth the effort but this isn't really a workout type of hike.  After all you're only gaining about 600 ft total. \n\nAvoiding the Ridgeline Trail cutting through the middle on part of the Basalt Trail cuts about a mile off the distance making this side great for a quick 3 mile exercise.

Steep climb goes from desert to cooler mountains\n\nThis is a challenging four-wheel-drive route but is also a great historical tour.

Located in Prescott National Forest.

Most hikers stay at either the Havasupai Lodge in Supai or the Havasupai Campground near Havasu Falls. \n\nTwo miles past Supai you will come across Havasu Falls, then Mooney Falls, then Beaver Falls. Some adventurous hikers may choose to go all the way to the confluence with the Colorado River.\n\nThe Havasupai Indian Reservation is not part of the Grand Canyon National Park, but you cannot tell that from the scenery. From your very first step at the trailhead parking lot until your return at the end of your trip, you will be swiveling your head side to side to take it all in.\n\nThe parking lot at the trailhead is stunning. It is perched more than 1000 feet above the valley floor and provides one of the best vistas of the trip.\n\nThe trail starts with a steep descent down the face of the box canyon to the valley floor on a  series of switchbacks. Be on the lookout for the approaching mules. They have the right-of-way, and won't stop to wait for you to move to the side.\n\nOnce you reach the valley floor, the trail bends to the north and follows the wash for 8 miles into the town of Supai. Along the way, the canyon walls draw closer and the surroundings become more grand. You get a sense for the true size of the canyon walls when then tower hundreds of feet straight up as you make your way down the canyon.\n\nThere is more shade in this narrow section of trail. The sun doesn't have the angle to penetrate the canyon and it helps to keep temperatures down. In this slot section ( which starts at about mile 7), you really need to watch for the mule packs. As they approach, move to the canyon wall side and not the cliff side.\n\nAt the end of the slot section, it opens and the Havasu Creek comes in from the right side.  As you cross the open expanse, following the trail as it curves to the left, you will hear the water for the first time. It comes into view as you enter the heavier vegetation. The town of Supai is close. You will follow the irrigation channel into Supai.\n\nThe two miles following the town of Supai are packed with waterfalls, blue-green water, and tons of photo opportunities. It's just 2 miles to Havasu Falls from Supai. The campground and Mooney Falls are just beyond that.

The trail is primarily used for hiking and rock climbing and is best used from October until May.	A strenuous hike through a wonderful canyon to some hot springs pools.\n\nThis hike is one of a kind.  There are 8 fixed ropes if you go all the way to the river.  Some are difficult especially when coming back up.  You will have wet boots and having them hold on the boulders you need to climb can be a slippery affair.\n\nAt the 1.5 mile point of the hike, you come to the first obstacle, a large boulder with what looks like a nasty drop off.  If you look at the rock wall to your right, you'll see some steps in the rock wall.  There is a strap here to help you down the steps.  Coming back, you really don't need the strap although it will give those who want some security an aid to come back up.\n\nA short distance after this, the wash opens into its widest of the hike, and several washes come in together.  Keep walking down and you'll come to the next rope.  This goes down the left side of the rock wall.  This isn't difficult to do.  You just need to use the rope as intended and walk down backwards while moving down the rope.  There is one other slight work around in this area, too.  There's a dry fall that some slide down.  There is a blue arrow painted on the rocks to the left of the chute showing you how to walk around and down this dry fall.\n\nAfter you have cleared these obstacles, you arrive at what once was the Upper Goldstrike Hot Springs pools.  Sadly, most have dried up.  There are a few pools farther down that still have water, but you'll see the remnants of the pools that no longer have any source for filling.\n\nThe rest has 5 fixed ropes, the last being a bit difficult, especially when you're coming back and you have those wet boots.\nThis trail can be too strenuous for dogs.

As you walk through this canyon, it is easy to imagine that you're transported back in time -- the grandeur and solitude (if you're lucky that is) of these brilliant red sandstone cliffs is almost overwhelming.  In the summertime, the heat in this canyon is stifling and intense -- best viewed early in the morning or just before sunset; daily summer highs usually exceed 100 degrees, and 120 degrees is considered common.  Carry water with you year-round.

Trail BLM404 (Black Mountain) is an easy hike most of the way until the last ½ mile when you might have to engage in some scrambling (class 2). Because of the distance and last segment of the hike, it is considered strenuous by most accounts; it kicked my butt pretty good \n\nYou access the trail via the Shadow Canyon Trailhead and follow a paved portion of the Anthem East Trail. There is a reservoir and you want to keep right of it (SE). You know you are on the right track if you pass by a small brick structure with a trail sign on it: find BLM404: this is the trail to Black Mountain. Follow along the top of the spillway till you see a sign that reads “Black Mountain Trail”. The trail itself is well marked from there and soon follows a ridgeline to the top. \n\nWarm weather hiking is difficult due to the lack of shade so bring plenty of water (3 liters when hot, 2-1 liters when cool). While the landscape is stark in the beginning, there are breathtaking views of the valleys below as you hike along a ridge line with some switch backs. \n\nAs you get to higher elevations, there are small windswept Joshua Trees and about three types of Barrel Cactus. As you approach 1/3 of a mile from the peak, there are nice clusters of Teddy Bear Cholla… but be careful: these cacti are painful to brush by and often have little clusters that have fallen off the mother plant scattered about. \n\nYou will know when you are getting close to the peak as the trail gets steeper and more rugged with loose rocks and a steeper assent. You might want to have your hands free to steady yourself at that point.\n\nThe view was amazing from the top and totally worth the hike!

From the signed trailhead the trail starts in a westward direction at a slight grade. It winds through thick patches of aspens and evergreens before passing by the alternative trail. The trail turns south and heads toward the magnificent Echo Cliffs. The Cliffs have a sheer drop of almost 1,000 feet. As the trail snakes to the west of Echo Cliffs, a side trail leads to a small seep. Water flows from the seep in the spring.\n\nOnce past Echo Cliffs, the trail heads west and the grade becomes steeper as it makes its way across a slope. As you traverse the slope, you can see the destruction an avalanche can wreak on a mountain. Many trees and boulders are still misplaced by an avalanche that happened years ago.\n\n The trail flattens out as it heads toward the backside of Cathedral Rock. This is the easiest and most enjoyable part of the trail, a cakewalk through a forest, and you forget that you're 8,000 feet above sea level.  \n\nSave your energy for the last quarter mile of the trail-it's steep. When the trail divides, go right on the unmarked footpath.   About a half-dozen switchbacks leads to the top of Cathedral Rock. The view becomes more spectacular with every step. On the far NE side there's a place to sit and admire the view. Mt. Charleston Lodge lies 1,000 feet below and farther to the east you can see the desert floor. To the north is Mummy Mountain; to the NW is Mary Jane Falls, and to the west is Charleston Peak.\n\nIf you eat lunch, you may have a visitor or two. This is the only place in the world you'll have the opportunity to see the Palmer Chipmunk. As hard as it is, resist feeding them. By feeding them they become dependent on humans for their food. In the winter the chipmunks must rely on their food-gathering skills or perish. Watch children closely at the top; the drop-offs are more than 500 feet at the edges. Railings have been erected, but they seem to entice people to climb down to them.\n

Parking is prohibited there, but you can park at the East Entrance parking lot and take a short 0.2 mile hike to get up close. Take the left fork in the open area to head back toward the main road and up the hill - this will take you right to the rock which is above you to the right as you reach the road.  You can easily climb to a vantage point above the rock to take the best pictures.  The trail continues along the road and bears off to the right and loops around the rock formations to come back toward the main parking lot on the other side.  The loop is 1.2 miles.  Watch for lizards and snakes.  \n\nThe rock formations are very interesting.  The Valley of Fire derives its name from red sandstone formations, formed from great shifting sand dunes during the age of dinosaurs. Complex uplifting and faulting of the region, followed by extensive erosion, have created the present landscape.  Other important rock formations include limestones, shales, and conglomerates. Prehistoric users of the Valley of\nFire included the Basket Maker people and later the Anasazi Pueblo farmers from the nearby fertile Moapa Valley.

Most climbers follow the upper path, which is a dirt/rock trail that works it way WNW under cliffs N of Pine Creek. If you enjoy bouldering, you can follow the stream up the canyon instead or you could easily miss the many ponds, pools, ferns, and lush vegetation. Use the dead pine in the photo as a landmark for when to leave the dirt/rock trail and enter the streambed. Follow the stream PAST the climbers launch for Dark Shadows, and turn the corner heading W into the canyon as the cliffs narrow above (N of Mescalito). As the canyon narrows, continue bouldering (class II and III), or scramble up the many game trails (very steep and rocky) to the end of the canyon (ends in seasonal waterfall).

The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from May until October. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.	The South Loop Trail starts off at an easy pace as it heads SW. The grade increases rapidly as the trail turns easterly and passes to the east of Echo Cliffs. As the trail turns back SW, it passes through the two sets of cliffs. To the north is Echo Cliffs; to the south is an unnamed cliff range. Also to the south is Springs Fork, one of many springs in Mt. Charleston. It's a short quarter-mile trek to the springs. \n \nThe trail follows a series of switchbacks as it climbs the backside of Echo Cliffs. There's a great overlook at the top of Echo Cliffs (two miles from the trailhead); Kyle Canyon, Mummy Mountain, and Cathedral Rock can be viewed from this overlook.  \n\nThe trail leaves the overlook and heads west with a gradual incline. It crosses drainage and starts a series of switchbacks that leads to the South Rim Plateau. Many of the switchbacks on the north end offer grand views of Kyle Canyon, Cathedral Rock, and Mummy Mountain. The landscape changes into a meadow before reaching the plateau. The last 100 yards are steep, but the view of Griffith Peak helps ease the pain. Upon reaching the plateau, a sign indicates the distances to Charleston Peak, Harris Saddle, and back to Kyle Canyon (the trailhead). The elevation is 10,700 feet; the distance to this point is four miles. \nThe trail heads west and soon enters a delightful meadow. This part of the trail is referred to as The Meadows and is a favorite spot for campers. The grade is slight with a few downhill sections. Charleston Peak comes into view several times during the ramble through the meadow. \n\nThe Meadows gives way to a grove of timber as the trail heads west and the grade increases. The trail hugs the ridgeline for more than half a mile, offering remarkable views of Kyle Canyon, Mt. Charleston Lodge, and State Route 157. Directly across the canyon is Mummy Mountain, and to the (west) left is North Ridge Rim.\n\nThe trail turns away from the ridgeline and heads SW before it climbs to another ridge. Off to the left is an unnamed peak that many hikers mistake for Mt. Charleston.  The trail rises to a saddle and Mt. Charleston ridgeline comes into view.  The trail heads NW toward the summit and away from the false peak. About 150 yards past the saddle a faint path to the south (left) travels down to Peak Springs. There's a sign marking the turnoff, but it's easily missed. The half-mile trek down to Peak Springs is very steep and you lose 900 feet in elevation. The hike back up to the trail is a killer, but if you need water Peak Springs is a reliable source.\n\nDue to the wind and elevation, the landscape becomes harsh. Bristlecone pines are reduced to twisted dwarfs. You're above 11,000 feet at this point, but luckily the incline is moderate. Charleston Peak looks more like a ridge than a summit from this angle. Just off the trail to the right are the remains of a 1955 plane crash. \n\nThe last half-mile to the peak is a steep 20% grade. Just before the peak the trail forks. Both trails go to the peak; however, the main trail is less steep. The wind can be harsh above the treeline. Bring a windbreaker. It's important to drink plenty of water before this final ascent. One cause of altitude sickness is a lack of water! \n\nCongratulations, you're standing, or lying down questioning your sanity, at the highest point in southern Nevada. Take a moment to experience the silence, breathe the clean air, and be thankful you're in good enough shape to stand at the peak. The summit offers a fantastic 360-degree view of southern Nevada, eastern California, and southern Utah. An Army box contains a sign-in book. A dug out fort that holds 10 people is a favorite resting point before starting back down. You can return the way you came up or make a loop by hiking down the North Loop Trail to Trail Canyon.

Strenuous 3,100' climb with spectacular 360 deg. view at peak (Calif to Ariz)\n\nYou begin to climb from your first step onto this trail, but you hike through some of the most lush, forested areas in these mountains.  Whether you marvel at the rugged cliffs, wonder at the caves and it's possible users, listen to the water rushing over the rocky ledges back in the canyons; or just revel in the colors of wildflowers & grasses at your feet, the smell of pines, or the sounds of birds, butterflies, and the wind rustling through the aspens; every aching muscle will be worth it on the South Loop Trail.  This is the easiest route to Mt. Charleston Peak (8 1/2 miles), and "just" reaching the crest of the ridge (4 miles up) and the lush meadows area (1/2 mile further) is a great sense of accomplishment and joy.  This is a perfectly acceptable trail for seasoned and conditioned horses (only a few rocky, narrow spots), but there is no water along this route so you'll have to pack plenty.

Charleston via Deer Creek Trail is a 14.7 mile moderately trafficked out and back trail located near Las Vegas, Nevada that features beautiful wild flowers and is rated as difficult. The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from July until October. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.	Mount Charleston is the highest summit in southern Nevada. The hike is all trail (no cross country) and is difficult. The hike passes by a 3,000 year old bristlecone pine.\n\nThe trail starts off at an easy grade wandering past ponderosa pine, pinion pine, and mountain mahogany. To the east on Angel Peak rests a large, white, ball-shape observatory. The trail has a few moderate switchbacks before reaching a plateau at about the 1.25 mile mark. Several bristlecone pines are scattered throughout this area indicating you are above 9,000 feet. After 12 moderately steep switchbacks, the trail climbs to 10,200 feet. It then descends 150 feet over the next 0.33 of a mile. Looking west you can see glimpses of Mummy Mountain. The limestone cliffs of Mummys Toe are hovering directly in front of the trail. Raintree, the giant bristlecone pine, is over 3,000 years old and acts as a dividing point. Continue another mile and a half to the junction of Trail Canyon. \n\nFrom the junction the North Loop Trail heads NW around Mummy Mountain. The grade is moderate as you enter the dead forest.  This "people-caused fire" in the late 1940s burned more than 500 acres. Scattered throughout the dead forest are aspens that turn orange and yellow in the fall. Look to the left (south), for a great view of Kyle Canyon; directly in front looms Charleston Peak.  \n\nAbout a mile from the junction is Cave Springs. Water runs into a horse trough and a path goes up to a cave-like overhang above the horse trough. The North Loop Trail continues southerly through the dead forest and aspens, as the grade becomes steeper. It makes a horseshoe bend and heads NE before switching back and heading west toward the North Rim Ridge. A little less than a mile from the horseshoe bend, a series of bluffs to the left of the trail offers great views of Kyle Canyon. The aspens disappear up here, since the elevation is more than 10,000 feet. \n\nThe trail flattens as it heads SW around the series of bluffs. Charleston Peak goes in and out of view as the trail starts to imitate a roller coaster. The trail flattens out again and cuts through a forest of bristlecone pines. Three overlooks to the north (right) offer the first views of the Sisters, Macks Peak, and McFarland Peak. The third overlook also has a great view of Charleston Peak and Kyle Canyon, making this one of the best views in the Mt. Charleston area. The trail continues in a SW direction as it winds along the base of cliffs. A few short but steep switchbacks bring you to the North Rim Ridge. As the final switchback turns to the left, a short path to the right leads to the ridge. Plan to spend a few minutes catching your breathe while you take in the fantastic view of all the northern mountains of the Mt. Charleston area.\n\nThe trail remains flat as it heads SE below Devils Thumb.  Mt. Charleston comes in and out of view as the trail traverses the rocky ledges. Trees are scarce since the elevation is over 11,000 feet. The trail heads around a few bluffs; it seems to take forever to arrive at the base of Charleston Peak. It makes one switchback and climbs around a final bluff before the near mile-long trek to the peak. \n\nThe last part of the trail is a series of steep switchbacks. The grade is 17%. It's important to drink plenty of water before and during this section. One cause of altitude sickness is a lack of water! \n\nCongratulations, you're standing, or lying down questioning your sanity, at the highest point in southern Nevada. Take a moment to experience the silence, breath the clean air, and be thankful you're in good enough shape to be standing on the peak. The peak offers a fantastic 360-degree view of southern Nevada, eastern California, and southern Utah. An Army box contains a sign-in book. A dug out fort is a favorite resting spot before starting back down.

The trail is primarily used for hiking, walking, nature trips, and birding and is best used from February until November.	The signed trail starts at the summit of Rocky Gap Road.  It heads SE with a slight incline, but soon levels. In about 400 yards the trail curves south and goes up a small hill. At the top of the hill you can see Rocky Gap road, the road you drove on to get to the trailhead. The incline becomes moderate as the trail heads NE and gains the next ridge. The trail passes outcrops as it stays on the crest of the ridge and heads east. After a few switchbacks, the trail nears the predominant north/south ridge. The trail stays a few feet below the ridge on the west side. As it heads south you pass a metal trail sign. Just after this point you get your first view of Bridge Mountain. What a contrast from the dull gray to the multi-colored sandstone. Two different worlds separated by the Keystone Thrust fault. \nThe trail heads south and stays along the top of the ridge, which affords great views of Bridge Mountain and, if clear, Las Vegas. You quickly pass a wooden trail sign. The views are soon obscured as the trail weaves behind a ridge. The trail curves to the east and the views out to the south rival the vista of Bridge Mountain. Juniper Peak, Rainbow Wall and Peak, and Mt. Wilson are seen from the trail. The vistas keep getting better as the trail curves to the north and Bridge comes back into view. \nThe trail starts to descend to the overlook. The deep canyon off to the right is Pine Creek Canyon. Follow the switchbacks down the red dirt and sandstone to the overlook. \nFrom the overlook, the idea is to climb down the shoulder to a bench. Begin by heading north down the wash 60 yards to where the terrain flattens. Follow the cairns across the sandstone heading directly toward Bridge Mountain. \nAs you pass the ponderosas, you cross a dry drainage. If you walk east (right) in the drainage you get a great view of Las Vegas. Once across the drainage, follow the cairns up the sandstone 50 yards to the first of three chutes.  A pine marks the start of the class 2 chute. \nAt the bottom of the chute, turn left and follow a short path through the manzanita bushes. Once back on sandstone, cairns and black marks lead you 50 feet to the second chute. Descend the class 3 chute. \nOnce down, follow the cairns and black marks to the third chute, which is only 20 yards away. After descending the chute, theres a 20- foot, class 3 wall you have to descend. Its only 15 yards from the bottom of the third chute. Follow the cairns down to the bench. You have descended the shoulder, now its easy going 150 yards across the bench. Hike up a steep ramp of sandstone to the start of the crack.  Theres a large black arrow on the west (left) wall of the crack. Follow the black marks up the crack. If it is windy stay in the crack; otherwise follow the black arrows when they point up and to the right. Climb out of the crack on the east (right) side and up the beehive sandstone. People who have a fear of heights should stay in the crack. The climb outside of the crack is exposed. Staying in the crack is more protected, but it is a harder climb.\nAs the crack passes a ledge, follow the black marks west (left) along a ledge for about 10 yards. You are now on the west (other) side of the crack. Climb the ramp as indicated by the marks. Its a 50 yard climb to the 30-foot tall and 50-foot wide arch. On the other side of the arch a giant ponderosa leans against the sandstone. This is a great area to take a break. \n\nContinue by going under the arch and friction climb along the left wall. A fallen log lies near the wall. At the top of the arch the dome-shape peak of Bridge Mountain can be seen. Go SE across the sandstone rim and around the Hidden Forest. \nThe final ascent heads NE along a steep ramp, which is well marked with cairns. At the top of the ramp, the peak stands to the south. Its an easy 40-yard trek to the peak from this point. A large cairn with a sign-in book marks the peak. A natural shelter sits just below the peak. This is a good place to have lunch and escape the wind. The view from the peak has to be seen to be appreciated. Its awesome.\n

Take a break from the slot machines for this paved loop trail that offers incredible desert and lake views.\n\nOne of the newest and most diverse additions to the list of outdoor activities in the Vegas area is the River Mountains Loop. With miles of smooth pavement, your recreation options include biking, inline skating, recumbents, Trikkes, hiking, trail-running, wheelchairs, and equestrian pursuits. It must be noted however, that while portions of the trail are great for all of the previously listed activities the entire loop is mostly suitable for biking, walking, and running. Only the most capable skaters, recumbent riders, and Trikke riders will be able to negotiate the entire trail due to a few very steep areas.\n\nAlthough this path is considered a rail-trail, only a little over 3.5 miles of the trail was actually converted from a former rail-bed. So the usual gradual inclines of rails-to-trails routes do not apply on this path. Some of the inclines are surprisingly steep for an asphalt trail.\n\nDespite the rigorous workout, the desert vistas and Lake Mead views make all of your efforts worthwhile. And if that isn't enough, many lucky trail-users are the recipients of stellar wildlife viewing including roadrunners, coyotes, deer, desert tortoises, and bighorn sheep.

Fun hike to explore old abandoned cabin above La Madre springs\n\nI've heard stories that this cabin was used by outlaws, miners, cowboys (line shack), and drifters.  Since there are abandoned mines above, and this canyon was used for livestock, there's probably some truth to all the stories.

You'll cross the creek bed several times so beware of both slippery rocks and erosion.  You can continue this trail beyond the cabin and eventually to La Madre ridge and peak, or just hike up and explore until you get tired.  Be sure and leave some energy for the descent, it can be steep and treacherous.  Although this cabin sees frequent use - for picnic & overnight (see park staff about primitive camp permit), most people respect the historic artifacts and remnants lying around.  Please do not remove or disturb anything -- it is protected and is illegal to take.

Even though this is a strenuous hike due to the steep switchbacks and elevation gain, it is a beautiful trail from the very beginning. The fall colors are magnificent, but this is a great way to escape the summer heat because you are under trees the entire time.  Aspens, cottonwoods and pines fill the avalanche chute at eye level, while brilliantly colored wildflowers and lush green grasses cover the soil.  Look for the large cave in the cliffs on your L as you cross back and forth across the side canyon, up the steep stone steps (do NOT take the gravel road to the L), and up the E side of the avalanche chute, climbing rapidly towards Echo Cliffs.  The slopes are generously covered with more flowers (lots of dark purples & brilliant red paintbrush), and you'll soon hear/see the water flowing down the falls/ledges back in the canyon toward the knob below Griffith Peak.  The overlook is a great place to stop, relax, lunch, etc.  but be very careful near the edge.

This loop is similar to the "Indian Creek Loop" from the Schad book, but longer, this version substitutes the Pine Mountain Trail for a bit of bushwacking Schad includes along Indian Creek.

After you cross the very small (and likely not reliable) Indian Creek, you head up a slope, and then make a right on Pine Mountain Trail.

On the downslope side of the picnic area (where there are latrines, picnic tables, and fire grills, but no water) you pick up the Pacific Crest Trail and head south toward the west slope of Garnet Peak. When you reach the turnoff for a left for Garnet Peak (while you can tack that on to lengthen the hike), for this version you instead turn right and head west, back towards Sunrise Highway. When you reach Sunrise Hwy, you then follow it south for a short distance back to the Noble Canyon Trailhead. You could also follow this route starting at Pioneer Mail Picnic Area.
